### Hi! I'm Draylar.

I'm a Java developer who also has a small bit of knowledge in Python, JavaScript, and Kotlin. I primarily work on Minecraft Modding using the [Fabric Mod Loader](http://fabricmc.net/). Some of my coolest modding projects include:
 - [Vanilla Hammers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-hammers), a hammer mod for 1.14, 1.15, and 1.16
 - [Draylar's Battle Towers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/draylars-battle-towers), my take on the famous Battle Towers mod
 - [Identity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/identity), a modern version of morph for 1.15 and 1.16

I also have experience working with the Java UI library, JavaFX:
 - [PDFReaderFX](https://github.com/Draylar/PDFReaderFX), a simple JavaFX-powered PDF reader
 - [StyleSquared](https://github.com/Draylar/StyleSquared), a material calculator
 - [MP3 Information Manager](https://github.com/Draylar/MP3-Information-Manager), a program for editing information stored in MP3 files
